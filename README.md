This is a collection of all my infographics that I made using GGPLOT. I usually get ideas from the amazing data journalism work at FiveThirtyEight, NY Times, WSJ, etc. I try to cater my infographics to Indian audience as there is a lack of data journalism in India. One of the major challenges is finding good data for India which is clean and reliable.

## 1. Floating Barplots

Visualized the daily maximum temperatures of Delhi as well as Mumbai and compared it to 7 day rolling average of the last three years.
